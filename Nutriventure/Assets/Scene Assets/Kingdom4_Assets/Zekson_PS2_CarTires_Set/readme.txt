Car Tires - FREE PS2 Style 3D Model Pack by Zekson 3D
==================================================

Hello! Thank you for downloading the "Car Tires" free 3D model pack.
This pack contains 2 unique models, and I hope you find them useful!

------------------------------
1. WHAT'S INSIDE THIS PACK
------------------------------
The resources in this pack are organized as follows:

1. Models Folder ('Models/'):
  *   Contains all 2 individual 3D models in .FBX format: CarTire_TypeA.fbx, CarTire_TypeB.fbx

2. Textures Folder ('Textures/'):
  *   Contains corresponding Diffuse texture maps in .PNG format for each model: CarTire_TypeA_D.png, CarTire_TypeB_D.png
  *Texture files are typically named to match their respective models.

3. Showcase Scene File:
  *   CarTires_Scene.fbx
  *   This is a pre-assembled scene file demonstrating how the models can look together, similar to the presentation on the store page. The individual, ready-to-use models are located in the 'Models' folder.

------------------------------
2. MODELS DETAILS
------------------------------
*   Style: Authentic PS2-era, low-poly aesthetic across all models.
*   Optimized: All models are designed to be versatile.
*   Polygon Count: 140 triangles per model.
*   Textures: Each model uses a single Diffuse map (256x512).
*   UV Unwrapped: Yes, all models have non-overlapping UVs.
*   File Format: All models in .FBX
*   Texture Format: All textures in .PNG

------------------------------
3. SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY
------------------------------
These models can be imported into most 3D software packages that support .FBX files, such as:
*   Blender
*   Autodesk Maya
*   Unity Engine
*   Unreal Engine
*   And many more!

------------------------------
4. GETTING STARTED
------------------------------
1. Open your preferred 3D software.
2. Import the desired .fbx model file(s) from the 'Models' folder within this pack.
3. For each imported model, locate its corresponding .png texture in the 'Textures' folder and apply it to the model's material.
   * Tip: Ensure the texture files are easily accessible by your software (e.g., in the same project folder or linked correctly in the material editor).
4. You're all set to incorporate the model(s) into your scene!
   * The showcase scene file (CarTires_Scene.fbx) can be opened for viewing or inspiration but individual assets for your projects are in the 'Models' folder.

------------------------------
5. USAGE & LICENSING (FREE ASSET PACK)
------------------------------
These 3D models (the "Assets") are provided FREE of charge by Zekson 3D. The copyright for these Assets remains with Zekson 3D.

When downloading from platforms like Sketchfab, these Assets may be offered under their standard licensing terms (e.g., Sketchfab's "Free Standard" license), which generally permit broad use (commercial, non-commercial, and derivative works). This readme file clarifies and adds specific conditions to such standard licenses, particularly regarding redistribution:

YOU ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM:
[-]   Reselling or redistributing the original or modified Assets (models and/or texture files), individually or as part of any collection, AS STANDALONE DIGITAL ASSETS. This specific restriction applies even if a general platform license might otherwise seem to permit broader redistribution. Standalone digital assets include, but are not limited to, offering them on other marketplaces, websites, or as part of another asset pack or library, whether for sale or for free.
[-]   Claiming ownership of the original Assets (models).
