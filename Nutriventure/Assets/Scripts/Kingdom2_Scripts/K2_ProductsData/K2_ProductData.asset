  - productID: AVOCADOCOLLECT
    displayName: Avocado
    productType: 0
    productPrefab: {fileID: 7419860229806312305, guid: 44c3bf479bda46549b6905aafd79a74b, type: 3}
    description: "Avocados contain almost no sugar only 0.2g, which is practically
      nothing. Instead, they\u2019re filled with healthy fats and fiber that keep
      you full and give you long-lasting energy without any sugar spike."
    labelTip: When a food has healthy fats + lots of fiber, it usually means low
      sugar.
    funFact: Avocados are considered superfruits, and they ripen faster when placed
      next to bananas!
  - productID: BANANACOLLECT
    displayName: Banana
    productType: 0
    productPrefab: {fileID: 2402274759429571662, guid: 8a2039a0c6f846143a50d34b99642955, type: 3}
    description: "Bananas contain natural fructose, which your body digests slowly
      thanks to the fiber inside the fruit. One banana has around 14g of natural
      sugar (3.5 teaspoons), but because it\u2019s packaged with nutrients like potassium
      and vitamins, it gives steady energy instead of a sugar spike."
    labelTip: Whole fruits like bananas naturally have 0g added sugar, even without
      a nutrition label.
    funFact: "Bananas are technically berries, and the trees they grow on aren\u2019t
      actually trees they're giant herbs!"
  - productID: COCOCOLLECT
    displayName: Coconut
    productType: 0
    productPrefab: {fileID: 9064385651540129686, guid: e6f197828a1a0ee4e9787161fb1bb3fc, type: 3}
    description: "Coconut has around 5\u20136g of natural sugar, but its high fiber
      content helps your body absorb it slowly. Unlike sugary coconut-flavored snacks,
      whole coconut provides nutrients like manganese and iron."
    labelTip: Coconut drinks in stores often have added sugar, so always look at
      the Added Sugars line.
    funFact: Coconuts can float for months, letting them travel across oceans and
      start new trees!
  - productID: BREADCOLLECT
    displayName: White Bread
    productType: 0
    productPrefab: {fileID: 5793490747404462157, guid: 14b6a702e3ae15b46a00cfed39acdf3b, type: 3}
    description: "White bread often includes 2\u20135g of added sugar per slice.
      The sugar helps the bread rise, become softer, and develop a brown crust. Because
      it's made from refined flour, the body turns it into sugar quickly, causing
      fast energy spikes."
    labelTip: Look out for hidden sugar names like dextrose, malt powder, and evaporated
      cane juice.
    funFact: "Bread turns golden-brown because of the Maillard Reaction \u2014 a
      tasty science moment between sugar and heat!"
  - productID: CEREALCOLLECT
    displayName: Cereals (Box)
    productType: 1
    productPrefab: {fileID: 1733681768320106238, guid: 40e66630baa69814d8b62579a58c58f0, type: 3}
    description: "Many cereals contain 8\u201320g of sugar (2\u20135 teaspoons) per
      serving, mostly added. Some are coated with sugar or flavored syrup. Even \u201Chealthy\u201D
      cereals can be sweetened, which is why serving size matters a small bowl may
      hide a lot of added sugars."
    labelTip: If sugar is in the first 3 ingredients, the cereal is high in added
      sugar.
    funFact: Cereal ads often use glue instead of milk in photos because real milk
      makes cereal soggy too fast!
  - productID: COOKIECOLLECT
    displayName: Packed Cookies
    productType: 1
    productPrefab: {fileID: 734968219280685595, guid: 6fab5704e4c0a8f4ba266c845eef8312, type: 3}
    description: "Packed cookies contain 10\u201318g of sugar (2.5\u20134.5 teaspoons)
      per serving. They often use several forms of added sugar like maltose, glucose
      syrup, and invert sugar to make them sweeter and longer-lasting. These sugars
      digest fast and give short bursts of energy."
    labelTip: If multiple sugar names appear in the ingredients list, the product
      is very high in added sugar.
    funFact: "Sugar helps cookies stay soft \u2014 it actually traps moisture like
      a sponge!"
  - productID: MILKCOLLECT
    displayName: Boxed Milk
    productType: 1
    productPrefab: {fileID: 6847286953101804840, guid: 4b896b1a38ba129489811bc808b6bb7b, type: 3}
    description: "Flavored milks (like chocolate or strawberry) usually contain 10\u201320g
      of sugar (2.5 to 5 teaspoons), mostly from added sugar. Natural milk sugar
      (lactose) is mild, but added sugar makes these drinks much sweeter \u2014 and
      faster to digest, causing quicker sugar spikes."
    labelTip: "Check the \u201CAdded Sugars\u201D line to see how much sweetener
      was added on top of natural milk sugar."
    funFact: Some flavored milks contain as much sugar as a small candy bar!
  - productID: SODACOLLECT
    displayName: Soft Drinks
    productType: 1
    productPrefab: {fileID: 2624451992907081943, guid: 47772403f29efbd4b96e8aacbf270ed5, type: 3}
    description: "A single can of soda holds 30\u201345g of sugar (7 to 11 teaspoons!)
      all from added sources like high-fructose corn syrup. Because soda has zero
      fiber, its sugar hits the bloodstream extremely fast, causing a big energy
      spike\u2026 and then a crash."
    labelTip: "If sugar is above 25g, that\u2019s already more than the daily recommended
      limit for teens."
    funFact: "The bubbles in soda aren\u2019t from magic \u2014 they\u2019re from
      carbon dioxide gas under pressure!"
